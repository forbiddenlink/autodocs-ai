2. ✅ Caching headers are set appropriately (Medium complexity)
3. ✅ Lighthouse accessibility score is 100 (Medium complexity)
4. ✅ All interactive elements are keyboard accessible (Complex)
5. ✅ Page titles are descriptive and unique (Simple)

### 🎯 Implementation Summary

#### 1. Page Titles (Simple - Completed)
- Added metadata exports to all pages with descriptive, unique titles

- Login page: "Sign In - AutoDocs AI" (dynamic via useEffect)
- Error page: "Error - AutoDocs AI" (dynamic via useEffect)
- 404 page: "404 - Page Not Found | AutoDocs AI" (static metadata)

**Files modified:**
- app/page.tsx - Added metadata export
- app/dashboard/page.tsx - Added dynamic title update
- app/login/page.tsx - Added dynamic title update
- app/error.tsx - Added dynamic title update
- app/not-found.tsx - Added metadata export

#### 2. CSS Optimization (Medium - Verified)
