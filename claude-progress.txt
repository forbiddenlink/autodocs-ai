### 🔧 Environment Setup Needed

Before implementing features, the next agent should:

1. Run `./init.sh` to set up environment
2. Create PostgreSQL database: `createdb autodocs_dev`
3. Run migrations: `cd backend && npm run migrate`
4. Set up API keys in .env files (can use dummy keys for testing)
5. Start both servers to verify setup works

### 💡 Implementation Notes

**Authentication Flow**:
- Use GitHub OAuth (requires GitHub App setup)
- Store user info in PostgreSQL
- JWT tokens for session management
- Middleware to protect routes

**Database**:
- Schema is ready, migrations created

### ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **NEVER** edit feature_list.json except to mark "passes": true
2. **ALWAYS** test features thoroughly before marking as passing
3. **COMMIT** frequently with descriptive messages
4. Work on features in dependency order
5. One feature at a time - complete before moving to next
6. Update this progress file before ending session
