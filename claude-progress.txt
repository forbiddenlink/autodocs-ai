```

### 🔧 Environment Setup Needed

Before implementing features, the next agent should:

1. Run `./init.sh` to set up environment
2. Create PostgreSQL database: `createdb autodocs_dev`
3. Run migrations: `cd backend && npm run migrate`
4. Set up API keys in .env files (can use dummy keys for testing)
5. Start both servers to verify setup works

### 💡 Implementation Notes

**Authentication Flow**:
- Use GitHub OAuth (requires GitHub App setup)
- Store user info in PostgreSQL
- JWT tokens for session management
- Middleware to protect routes

**Database**:
- Schema is ready, migrations created
- Connection pooling configured
- Proper indexes for performance
- Trigger functions for timestamps

**Logging**:
- Winston logger configured
- Logs to console and files
- Different log levels (error, warn, info, debug)

**Error Handling**:
- Centralized error handler
- 404 handler for unknown routes
- User-friendly error messages

### ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **NEVER** edit feature_list.json except to mark "passes": true
2. **ALWAYS** test features thoroughly before marking as passing
3. **COMMIT** frequently with descriptive messages
4. Work on features in dependency order
5. One feature at a time - complete before moving to next
6. Update this progress file before ending session

### 🚀 Ready for Next Agent

The foundation is complete. Next agent can begin implementing features starting with #1 (landing page).

All core infrastructure is in place:
- ✅ Project structure
- ✅ Database schema
- ✅ Backend server foundation
- ✅ Frontend structure
- ✅ Logging and error handling
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Comprehensive feature list

**Status**: Ready for feature implementation 🎉

## Session 2 - Security & Configuration Verification (Completed)
**Date**: 2024-12-24
**Agent**: Implementation Agent

### ✅ Completed Tasks

Successfully completed 5 security and configuration tests:

1. **Test #1: Landing page loads successfully** ✅

   - Verified description and CTA buttons ("Get Started", "Learn More")
   - Verified "Key Features" section with 6 feature cards
   - Verified page loads without errors
